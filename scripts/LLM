Please write R code to clean data:

To clean the data in the `moneydataABCDEF.xlsx` Excel file you uploaded, I'll outline a step-by-step process in R. This process will include reading the Excel file, inspecting it for common data issues (like missing values, duplicates, or incorrect data types), and applying necessary cleaning steps.

1. **Reading the Excel File**: We'll use the `readxl` package to read the Excel file.
2. **Inspecting the Data**: We will inspect the data for missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types.
3. **Cleaning the Data**: Based on the inspection, we'll apply cleaning steps such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and converting data types as needed.

Here's a sample R script that follows this process:

```r
# Load necessary packages
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)

# Step 1: Reading the Excel file
data <- read_excel("/mnt/data/moneydataABCDEF.xlsx")

# Step 2: Inspecting the Data
# Checking the first few rows to understand the data structure
head(data)

# Checking for missing values
summary(data)

# Checking for duplicates
any(duplicated(data))

# Step 3: Cleaning the Data
# Removing duplicates (if any)
data_cleaned <- data %>%
  distinct()

# Handling missing values
# This could involve imputation, removing rows, or even filling with a specific value
# Example: Replacing NA values with 0 (this is just an example, adjust based on your need)
data_cleaned <- data_cleaned %>%
  mutate_if(is.numeric, ~replace(., is.na(.), 0))

# Converting data types if necessary
# Example: Converting a character column to factor
# data_cleaned$YourColumn <- as.factor(data_cleaned$YourColumn)

# Inspect the cleaned data
summary(data_cleaned)

# Optionally, write the cleaned data back to a new Excel file
write.xlsx(data_cleaned, "/mnt/data/moneydataABCDEF_cleaned.xlsx")
```

This script is a basic starting point. Depending on the specific issues and requirements of your dataset, you might need to perform more complex cleaning operations such as outlier detection, normalization, or encoding categorical variables. If you have specific cleaning tasks or data issues in mind, please let me know so I can provide more targeted advice.


could not find function "write.xlsx":

If you encountered an error stating "could not find function 'write.xlsx'", it suggests that the function or the package containing it was not available in your R environment. The `write.xlsx` function is part of the `openxlsx` package, not a default R base function, so you need to install and load this package before using the function.

Here's how you can correct the issue:

1. **Install the `openxlsx` package** (if you haven't already):

```r
install.packages("openxlsx")
```

2. **Load the `openxlsx` package** at the beginning of your script:

```r
library(openxlsx)
```

3. **Use the `write.xlsx` function** from the `openxlsx` package to write the file:

```r
write.xlsx(data_cleaned, "/mnt/data/Money_Illusion_Brazil_Sample_Cleaned.xlsx")
```

Make sure these steps are included in your R script to avoid the "could not find function 'write.xlsx'" error. This will ensure you can successfully save your cleaned data to an Excel file.

The purpose of my paper is to replicate the original article I uploaded above. Use the same dataset but a different method to analyze the data. I need you to write R code to graph an interesting plot focus on problem 1:

The original article focuses on replicating the "money illusion" effect within a Brazilian context, examining how individuals perceive financial decisions when nominal and real values are contrasted. Specifically, Problem 1 deals with individuals' perceptions of job attractiveness and economic advantage based on different salary increases under varying inflation conditions. It tests whether participants are more likely to believe a person would quit their job if offered a larger wage increase in real terms, despite it being smaller in nominal terms. The results showed a significant presence of money illusion, particularly when the question was framed around job attractiveness, with participants more likely to select the option with a higher nominal increase over the real one.

For your analysis, creating an R plot that illustrates the differences in participant responses to Problem 1 could be insightful. You could visualize the proportion of participants choosing each option (Maria vs. Carolina) across different framings of the question (economic terms, happiness, job attractiveness). This would highlight how framing affects perceptions of economic advantage and job satisfaction, emphasizing the money illusion effect.

Let's proceed with writing the R code for such a plot, assuming you have the dataset ready with variables for participants' choices across the different conditions.

Here's a sample R code that generates a plot illustrating the distribution of choices for Problem 1, focusing on the conditions of economic terms, happiness, and job attractiveness. This plot will help visualize how participants' choices were influenced by the framing of the question, highlighting the money illusion effect:

```r
# Install necessary packages if not already installed
if (!require(ggplot2)) install.packages("ggplot2")

# Load ggplot2 for plotting
library(ggplot2)

# Sample data: Replace with your actual dataset
problem1_data <- data.frame(
  Condition = factor(c("Economic Terms", "Happiness", "Job Attractiveness"), levels = c("Economic Terms", "Happiness", "Job Attractiveness")),
  Choice = c("Maria", "Maria", "Maria", "Carolina", "Carolina", "Carolina"),
  Percentage = c(78, 49, 62, 22, 51, 38) # Example percentages based on the provided summary
)

# Plot
ggplot(problem1_data, aes(x = Condition, y = Percentage, fill = Choice)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Pastel1") +
  labs(title = "Choices in Problem 1: Economic Terms, Happiness, and Job Attractiveness",
       x = "Condition",
       y = "Percentage (%)",
       fill = "Choice") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

# Display the plot
ggsave("Problem1_Choices_Plot.png", width = 8, height = 6, dpi = 300)
```

This code block defines a simple dataset based on the summarized findings from the original article and creates a bar plot with ggplot2. The `Condition` variable represents the different framings of the question in Problem 1. `Choice` indicates the selected option (Maria or Carolina), and `Percentage` reflects the percentage of participants choosing each option under each condition. The plot is saved as a PNG file. Remember to replace the sample data with your actual dataset by modifying the `problem1_data` dataframe accordingly.


write an R code to graph a table of the data of problem 1. considering table 1 from the original article, do something similar.:

Based on the data presented in Table 1 of the original article for Problem 1, I will guide you through writing R code to graph a table similar to Table 1, focusing on participants' choices between Maria or Carolina in each condition of Problem 1. The table will include counts and percentages for each choice across the conditions (Economic Terms, Happiness, Job Attractiveness), as well as the chi-square test results and p-values.

Here is a sample R code using the `gt` package to create a graph-like table that visually represents the data for Problem 1:

```r
# Load necessary libraries
if (!require(gt)) install.packages("gt")
library(gt)

# Define the data
problem1_data <- data.frame(
  Condition = c("Economic Terms", "Happiness", "Job Attractiveness"),
  Maria_n = c(87, 58, 69),
  Maria_percent = c("78%", "49%", "62%"),
  Carolina_n = c(25, 60, 43),
  Carolina_percent = c("22%", "51%", "38%"),
  Chi_Square = c(34.32, 0.03, 6.04),
  P_value = c("< 0.001", "0.854", "0.014")
)

# Create the table
gt_table <- gt(problem1_data) %>%
  tab_header(
    title = "Problem 1: Participants' Choices Between Maria or Carolina",
    subtitle = "Across Different Conditions"
  ) %>%
  cols_label(
    Condition = "Condition",
    Maria_n = "Maria n(%)",
    Maria_percent = "",
    Carolina_n = "Carolina n(%)",
    Carolina_percent = "",
    Chi_Square = "Chi-Square",
    P_value = "P-value"
  ) %>%
  fmt(
    columns = vars(Chi_Square, P_value),
    fns = list(
      ~.x %>% as.character()
    )
  ) %>%
  tab_spanner(
    label = "Maria",
    columns = vars(Maria_n, Maria_percent)
  ) %>%
  tab_spanner(
    label = "Carolina",
    columns = vars(Carolina_n, Carolina_percent)
  )

# Print the table
print(gt_table)
```

This code defines a dataset that mimics the structure of Table 1 from the original article, focusing on the choices between Maria or Carolina across different conditions. The `gt` package is used to create a visually appealing table that includes both count and percentage data for each choice, along with the chi-square statistics and p-values for each condition. 

Remember to adjust the dataset (`problem1_data`) with your actual data if you have it. This example uses fabricated numbers based on the details you provided for demonstration purposes.


 
You
to replicate figure 2 in "Preprint_Replication of the “money illusion” effect in a Brazilian sample", use the same dataset but a different method to analyze the data. I need you to write R code to graph an interesting plot focus on problem 2.

For Problem 2 in the study "Preprint_Replication of the 'money illusion' effect in a Brazilian sample," the focus is on individuals' ability to rank the best deals among three house sellers based on nominal versus real gains. The original findings, as summarized, indicate a strong presence of money illusion, with a significant portion of participants favoring choices that represent better nominal gains rather than real gains, despite the latter being economically disadvantageous when inflation is considered.

To create a new and interesting plot using R that focuses on Problem 2, we will utilize a different method to analyze and visualize the data. This could involve comparing the participants' rankings of the sellers (André, Bento, and Marcelo) in a way that highlights the discrepancies between nominal and real value perceptions. For example, we can visualize the proportion of participants who ranked each seller as providing the best deal under the illusion of nominal gains versus those who made choices aligned with real economic advantage.

Let's proceed with writing the R code to generate such a plot. The code will create a bar plot that shows the percentage of participants who ranked each of the three sellers (André, Bento, Marcelo) as offering the best, second best, and worst deals. This visualization will help in understanding how strongly the participants were influenced by the money illusion when making their rankings.

```r
# Load necessary libraries
if (!require(ggplot2)) install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

# Example dataset: Update this with your actual data
# Assuming the dataset contains the rankings for each seller from the participants
data <- data.frame(
  Seller = rep(c("André", "Bento", "Marcelo"), each = 3),
  Ranking = rep(c("Best Deal", "Second Best", "Worst Deal"), 3),
  Percentage = c(35, 16, 49,  # Percentages for André
                 21, 68, 11,  # Percentages for Bento
                 43, 16, 41)  # Percentages for Marcelo
)

# Create the plot
ggplot(data, aes(x = Seller, y = Percentage, fill = Ranking)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Pastel1") +
  labs(title = "Ranking of House Sellers Based on Deals",
       x = "Seller",
       y = "Percentage (%)",
       fill = "Ranking") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

# Note: Customize the 'data' dataframe with your dataset.
```

This R code snippet is designed for a hypothetical dataset and needs to be adapted to your specific dataset by updating the `data` dataframe. This plot aims to visually represent how the participants' perceptions of nominal versus real gains influenced their rankings of the sellers, directly reflecting the money illusion effect as investigated in Problem 2 of the study.


could you write best/second/third choice on the x-axis? Do not need to change other factors.

To adjust the R code so that the x-axis labels reflect the ranking of the house sellers as "Best Choice," "Second Choice," and "Third Choice" instead of their names, we'll modify the data frame to focus on the ranking aspect and then adjust the plotting code accordingly. Here's how you can do it:

```r
# Load necessary libraries
if (!require(ggplot2)) install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

# Assuming the dataset is structured to reflect participants' preferences
data <- data.frame(
  Choice = rep(c("Best Choice", "Second Choice", "Third Choice"), each = 3),
  Seller = rep(c("André", "Bento", "Marcelo"), 3),
  Percentage = c(
    # Best Choice Percentages for André, Bento, Marcelo
    35, 21, 43, 
    # Second Choice Percentages for André, Bento, Marcelo
    16, 68, 16, 
    # Third Choice Percentages for André, Bento, Marcelo
    49, 11, 41
  )
)

# Create the plot
ggplot(data, aes(x = Choice, y = Percentage, fill = Seller)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Pastel1") +
  labs(title = "Participants' Preferences for House Sellers",
       x = "",
       y = "Percentage (%)",
       fill = "Seller") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

# Note: Customize the 'data' dataframe with your actual dataset.
```

This code snippet modifies the original approach by focusing on the participants' rankings (Best Choice, Second Choice, Third Choice) as the primary categories on the x-axis, and it uses the sellers' names as the fill variable for distinguishing the bars. This adjustment provides a clearer visualization of how participants ranked the sellers in terms of perceived deal quality, directly aligning with the analysis of the money illusion effect in Problem 2.


 
You
write an R code to graph a table of the data of problem 2. considering table 2 from the original article, do something similar.

To replicate a table similar to Table 2 from the "Preprint_Replication of the 'money illusion' effect in a Brazilian sample" for Problem 2 using R, we will create a graphical table that summarizes the participants' choices among the three house sellers (André, Bento, Marcelo), including their first, second, and third choice preferences, along with chi-square test results and p-values. This table will help visualize the presence of money illusion as it relates to real estate transactions in the study.

Here's an R code snippet using the `gt` package to create a graph-like table:

```r
# Load necessary libraries
if (!require(gt)) install.packages("gt")
library(gt)

# Define the data for Problem 2 replication results
problem2_data <- data.frame(
  Seller = c("André", "Bento", "Marcelo"),
  First_Choice_Percent = c("35%", "21%", "43%"),
  Second_Choice_Percent = c("16%", "68%", "16%"),
  Third_Choice_Percent = c("49%", "11%", "41%"),
  Chi_Square = c(45.64, 153.55, 36.79),
  P_Value = c("< 0.001", "< 0.001", "< 0.001")
)

# Create the table
gt_table <- gt(problem2_data) %>%
  tab_header(
    title = "Replication Results for Problem 2: House Sellers Ranking",
    subtitle = "Participants' Preferences and Statistical Analysis"
  ) %>%
  cols_label(
    Seller = "Seller",
    First_Choice_Percent = "1st Choice (%)",
    Second_Choice_Percent = "2nd Choice (%)",
    Third_Choice_Percent = "3rd Choice (%)",
    Chi_Square = "Chi-Square",
    P_Value = "P-Value"
  ) %>%
  tab_spanner(
    label = "Choice Preferences",
    columns = vars(First_Choice_Percent, Second_Choice_Percent, Third_Choice_Percent)
  ) %>%
  tab_spanner(
    label = "Statistical Analysis",
    columns = vars(Chi_Square, P_Value)
  )

# Print the table
print(gt_table)
```

This code sets up a data frame with the results for Problem 2, mirroring the structure of Table 2 from the article. It then uses the `gt` package to create a table that displays each seller's percentage of being ranked as the first, second, and third choice, along with chi-square values and p-values to assess the statistical significance of the results. This table effectively communicates the extent of the money illusion among participants as it pertains to evaluating real estate deals, highlighting their tendency to prioritize nominal gains over real value.
